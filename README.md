Add devise authentication and login screen and users

Add ability to rename envelopes

Add task to back up the DB sense this isn't running somewhere reliable.

Some of the mdl grids, cells and cards are not lining up.

Be able to tag transactions with a further description. Example of use:
    - the google pay $16 was sherlock!!!

Use the MDL Snackbar for selecting which envelope to put a transaction into?
